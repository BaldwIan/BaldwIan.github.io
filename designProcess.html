				As the theme has yet to been announced, this was a very lax day. What we worked on was:
				<ul>
					<li>Creation of team planning document to go in drive ('Every Day Workflow')</li>
					<li>Practice sketching for pixel art</li>
					<li>General discussion of our plan once theme was announced - we would just write down all of our ideas</li>
				</ul>

				Theme is announced! Very big day for us, we were very excited and wanted to get our ideas down as fast as possible. What we accomplished was:
				<ul>
					<li>Dump all of our initial ideas onto brainstorming document we created on 14 Nov</li>
					<li>Debated which ideas to keep and which to discard</li>
					<li>Discussed type of game we would make to suit our needs - side scroller vs top-down isometric</li>
					<li>Decided that our game would be a farming/ combat based rpg</li>
					<li>Brainstormed about combat system, whether we should have a money system, mining, farming, and day cycles</li>
					<li>Decided that fast travel would be a bad idea</li>
					<li>Decided that the game would be top-down isometric rather than a sidescroller because it fits our ideas of playstyle much better</li>
					<li>Talked about art styles, looked at a particular style - hextech</li>
					<li>Made a goal of which achievments in the OGPC list we would decide to gurantee complete</li>
					<li>Prototyped and looked at some concept ideas for art relating to our style</li>
					<li>Discussed how we would keep our sanity while working, and about how much work we would have every day</li>
					<li>Talked about the process of animating, and how to keep animation to a minimum</li>
					<li>Talked about general idea of map layout</li>
					<li>Talked about how we might change our map, and how the player would travel between areas - inconclusive</li>
					<li>Tried but didn't figure out how we would force the player to want to progress</li>
				</ul>
